The [provider](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxMap/Configuration/#provider) property specifies the map provider used: Google Maps (default), Azure Maps, Google Static Maps, or Bing Maps (deprecated).

You can also set the [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxMap/Configuration/#type) property to specify desired map type: road, satellite (photographic), or hybrid map.

[note]

On May 21, 2024, Microsoft announced that [Bing Maps for Enterprise and its API will be discontinued](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/bing-maps/discontinued-services). Moving forward, [Azure Maps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-maps/) will be Microsoft’s unified enterprise mapping platform.

If you have an existing Bing Maps for Enterprise license, you can continue using Bing alongside our Map component until support ends. You need to transition to a new API before June 30, 2025 (free and basic license) or before June 30, 2028 (enterprise license).

The last date you can get a new Bing Maps for Enterprise license is June 30, 2024. If you do not have an existing license after this date, you can only use other [map providers](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxMap/Types/#MapProvider) supported by our controls: Azure, Google, and Google Static.
